## Description
- This project includes a backend JavaScript Readme Generator. Using Node JS, you're given a prompt in the command line which asks questions based on a ReadMe for GitHub. You're even given access to various licenses with a badge that appears once selected. As well as, a link to your GitHub and Email.
- My motivation for working and creating this project was to further grasp the idea of backend development, understanding Node JS, and to create a faster way to make a Readme file. I also learned about package.json and adding NPM packages to your projects.

## Usage 
- You're given access to a command prompt once you run (node index)
- Once you type in that input, the program runs... In which you're given access to various questions regarding the information required for your ReadMe to be generated.
- Once that's done, you're given a new file in the Test-Folder which is access to your new mark-up file!
## Features 
- Access to a command prompt program that gathers your answers to various requests for a ReadMe file
- Various licenses to choose from along with a badge icon for the license you select.
- Once completed you're given a new mark-up file that is located in the Test-Folder to preview.
